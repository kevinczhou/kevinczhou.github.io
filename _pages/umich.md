I will be starting the **High-Performance Computational Optics Lab** at the University of Michigan in March 2025! The lab will develop a wide variety of new computational optical imaging systems to the address unmet needs across biology and medicine. We have particular interest in developing new multidimensional imaging systems with very high spatiotemporal throughput -- that is, systems that can capture billions to even *trillions* of pixels or voxels per second, including computational methods to process, analyze, and visualize such big data.  

Our philosophy is that the optical hardware and the computational image reconstruction software are both equally important -- innovations in neither alone will take us to our destinations. We will work closely with our biomedical collaborators to maximize the impact of our computational imaging systems.

## We are actively recruiting!
Achieving these ambitious goals will not be possible without your help! If you have experience in and/or are interested in optical imaging (e.g., microscopy, OCT, holography, computational imaging/photography, lens design) and computation (e.g., machine learning, computer vision/graphics, signal processing), please feel free to reach out to me!

Prospective **PhD students** looking to start Fall 2025, please apply to the [U-M BME PhD program](https://bme.umich.edu/academics/graduate/graduate-admissions/) and mention my name in your application.

Prospective **postdocs**, please send me an email with your CV and a brief description of your past research and future goals.

Current U-M **undergrads** in engineering, CS, or related fields should also feel free to reach out!
