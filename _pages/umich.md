I will be starting the **High-Performance Computational Optics Lab** at the University of Michigan in March 2025! The lab will develop new computational optical imaging systems to the address unmet needs in biology and medicine. We have particular interest in developing new multidimensional imaging systems with very high spatiotemporal throughput -- that is, systems that can capture billions to even *trillions* of pixels or voxels per second, including computational methods to process, analyze, and visualize such big data.

Our philosophy is that the optical hardware and the computational image reconstruction software are equally important -- innovations in neither alone will take us to our destinations.
