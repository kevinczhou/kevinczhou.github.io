I am a [2022 Schmidt Science Fellow](https://schmidtsciencefellows.org/fellows/) and postdoc at UC Berkeley, working with Profs. [Laura Waller](http://www.laurawaller.com/) and [Hillel Adesnik](https://adesnik.berkeley.edu/). Before that, I was a postdoc (with Prof. [Roarke Horstmeyer](https://horstmeyer.pratt.duke.edu/)) and PhD student (with Profs. [Joseph Izatt](http://biophotonics.pratt.duke.edu/), [Warren Warren](https://chem.duke.edu/labs/warren/overview), and [Sina Farsiu](http://people.duke.edu/~sf59/)) at Duke University, where my research was supported in part by an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship.

My research interests are broadly in computational imaging, coherent (and incoherent) optical imaging, tomographic reconstruction algorithms, inverse problems, and machine learning. I have particular experience with optical coherence tomography (OCT), camera array-based microscopy, Fourier ptychography, diffraction tomography, and nonlinear microscopy, but I'm always open to exploring and applying computational optimization techniques to other forms of imaging!

Prior to Duke, I graduated from Yale University in 2015 with a BS in biomedical engineering, where I was introduced to the world of optical imaging. In particular, I did some research involving OCT with Prof. [Michael Choma](https://medicine.yale.edu/profile/michael_choma/) and multiphoton microscopy with Prof. [Michael Levene](https://medicine.yale.edu/research-profile/michael_levene/). I've also dabbled a bit in historical linguistics with Prof. [Claire Bowern](https://ling.yale.edu/people/claire-bowern), applying computational techniques and Bayesian statistics to study language evolution.
