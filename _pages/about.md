I am a PhD student at Duke University jointly advised by Profs. Joseph Izatt and Warren Warren. I also collaborate closely with Profs. Sina Farsiu and Roarke Horstmeyer. My research interests are broadly in computational imaging, coherent (and incoherent) optical imaging, tomographic reconstruction algorithms, inverse problems, and machine learning. I have particular experience with optical coherence tomography, Fourier ptychography, diffraction tomography, and nonlinear microscopy, but I'm always open to exploring and applying computational techniques to other forms of imaging!
