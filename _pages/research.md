A major theme of my research is high-throughput computational 3D imaging techniques. Some projects include:
- [Computational 3D imaging with camera arrays](#computational-3d-imaging-with-camera-arrays)
- [Multiview imaging over extremely wide angular ranges](#multiview-imaging-over-extremely-wide-angular-ranges)
- [Optical coherence refraction tomography (OCRT)](#optical-coherence-refraction-tomography-OCRT)

## Computational 3D imaging with camera arrays
Coming soon!

## Multiview imaging over extremely wide angular ranges
Coming soon!

## Optical coherence refraction tomography (OCRT)
OCRT is a new computational 3D microscopy technique that incorporates extreme angular diversity to incoherently enhance resolution and reduce speckle of conventional OCT.

OCRT registers multi-angle OCT images or volumes by solving an inverse refraction problem, a process that also computationally reconstructs a 3D refractive index map of the sample. The following video demonstrates the marked improvement of 3D OCRT over conventional OCT volumetric data:
