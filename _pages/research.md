A major theme of my research is high-throughput computational 3D imaging techniques. Some projects include:
- [Computational 3D imaging with camera arrays](#computational-3d-imaging-with-camera-arrays)
- [Multiview imaging over extremely wide angular ranges](#multiview-imaging-over-extremely-wide-angular-ranges)
- [Optical coherence refraction tomography (OCRT)](#optical-coherence-refraction-tomography-OCRT)

## Computational 3D imaging with camera arrays
Coming soon!

## Multiview imaging over extremely wide angular ranges
